Introduction
Music recommender systems are an essential component of modern music streaming platforms, helping users discover new music they might enjoy based on their listening history and preferences. This project aims to develop a music recommender system using Python and various machine learning algorithms.
Features

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends music based on similarities between song characteristics.
Content-based Filtering: Recommends music based on the attributes of the songs themselves, such as genre, artist, and audio features.
Hybrid Approach: Combines multiple recommendation techniques to provide more personalized and accurate recommendations.
